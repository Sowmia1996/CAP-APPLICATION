8098ea0a-e4b9-3265-9a21-95758a1e49e1,3,average book at best,After having read the other two books And the Mountains echoed and The Kite Runner I knew I had to read this  irresistible creation.A thought provoking and mind blowing read only hardest of hearts can fail to move.A saga of two women fighting against all odds after having faced them this shows us that behind every burqa there is a human being.,111,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin
8098ea0a-e4b9-3265-9a21-95758a1e49e2,5,Best book by markus,This is a tragic and a very beautiful story in this book we see that the death itself is narrating the story as it follows a girl  Liesel Meminger during world war 2 in Germany . she lost her  brother and steals her very first book during the journey towards her foster parents.,203,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin
8098ea0a-e4b9-3265-9a21-95758a1e49e3,2,eccentric plot,There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible and arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks and the implications it conceals are soul-curdling and unforgettable.,222,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin,2019-11-26T03:29:46.178Z,Admin
